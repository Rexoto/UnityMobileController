# UnityMobileController
Control unity games remotely (e.g. Phone as controller) over Wi-Fi.
Uses [LiteNetLib](https://github.com/RevenantX/LiteNetLib) with UDP to send inputs with minimal delay without missing inputs.
NAT Punchthrough means no messing arount with port forwarding and IP settings so its easy for end users to jump straight into the game.
A few basic example games are included to show it in action.
